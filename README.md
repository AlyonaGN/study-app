This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

Set Up

1. Please go to the root directory and run `npm i`
2. Then go to the /backend directory and run `npm i`
3. In the /backend directory run `node server.js `
4. Open a new terminal and go to the root directory and run rpm run dev
5. In the browser open http://localhost:3000/'

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.
